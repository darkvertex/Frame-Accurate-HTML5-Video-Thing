Prototype I built a few years back to provide controls to accurately move through a video embedding in a web page using the HTML5 video element. In no way production code but might be useful for reference. I only uploaded it to here as I was seeing people getting 404s when they came here from a BBC blog post I'd forgotten commenting on.
